what is the differentiation of determinant(A-lambda*I) so A is a square matrix and i is a unity matrix give in matrix calculus

Certainly! Let 
�
A is a square matrix, 
�
λ is a scalar, and 
�
I is the identity matrix of the same size as 
�
A. The expression 
det
⁡
(
�
−
�
�
)
det(A−λI) represents the determinant of the matrix 
�
−
�
�
A−λI. To find the derivative of this determinant with respect to 
�
λ, we can use the matrix calculus.

Let 
�
=
�
−
�
�
B=A−λI. The derivative of 
det
⁡
(
�
)
det(B) with respect to 
�
λ is given by:

�
�
�
det

(

 det(B)=

​
 det(A−λI)

Using the matrix derivative formula, we have:

�
�
�
det

=

(
adj
(
�
)
�
�
�

)
dλ
d
​
 det(B)=trace(adj(B) 
dλ
d
​
 B)

Here, 
trace
trace denotes the trace of a matrix, 
adj
(
�
)
adj(B) is the adjugate (or adjoint) matrix of 
�
B, and 
�
�
�
�
dλ
d
​
 B is the derivative of 
�
B with respect to 
�
λ.

Given that 
�
=
�
−
�
�
B=A−λI, the derivative 
�
�
�
�
dλ
d
​
 B is simply equal to 
−
�
−I (since the derivative of 
�
�
λI with respect to 
�
λ is 
�
I).

So,

�
�
�
det

=

dλ

​
 det(B)=trace(adj(B)(−I))

This can be further simplified to:

�
�
�

(
�

)
=
−
trace
(
adj
(
�
−
�
�
)
)
dλ

​
 det(A−λI)=−trace(adj(A−λI))

Note that calculating the adjugate matrix involves finding the cofactor matrix, transposing it, and then multiplying by the determinant of the original matrix. The adjugate matrix is denoted as 
adj
(
�
)
adj(B) in the formula above.

The above expression gives you the derivative of the determinant of a matrix with respect to a scalar parameter.

the −trace(adj(A−λI))
the −trace(adj(A−λI))

 of this expand it so adj matrix instead use an alternative matrix operation

Certainly! The expression 
−

(
adj
(
�
−
�
�
)
)
−trace(adj(A−λI)) can be expanded using an alternative matrix operation. Instead of using the adjugate matrix, we can express the determinant in terms of the matrix inverse. The formula for the derivative of the determinant with respect to a scalar parameter 
�
λ becomes:

�
�
�

Now, let's find

�
�

(

So, the expression becomes:

Now, simplify further:

This expression gives you the derivative of the determinant of
